# The Slow Draft — Astro static site

A personal blog with essays, an about page, recommended resources and an RSS feed.
Built with **Astro 7** as a fully static site: `npm run build` writes plain HTML,
CSS and fonts — no server, no database, no runtime dependencies. Drop the output
on Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3 or any web host.

The design is the same warm-paper look as before: the same stylesheet, the same
self-hosted typefaces, the same layout, verified page by page against the
original build.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321 — writing with live reload
npm run build      # → ./dist   (17 pages, ~1s)
npm run preview    # serve ./dist locally to check the real output
npm run verify     # CMS config + admin bundle + writing desk + build + link audit

npm run check:desk     # the desk's markdown, frontmatter and built page
npm run check:desk:ui  # a whole writing session, driven in a real DOM
npm run test:desk      # …and a real build of a post the desk committed
```

Requires **Node 22.12+** (Astro 7's minimum).

## Writing from the browser — the private desk at /write/

Your editor is a single page in the site itself: **`/write/`**. Open it on your
phone or laptop, paste a GitHub token once, and write. Pressing **Publish**
commits the markdown file straight to this repository; your host sees the commit,
rebuilds, and the post is live about a minute later.

There is **no server, no database and no CMS behind it** — the page is 30 KB of
bundled JavaScript that talks only to `api.github.com`, so it works on Netlify,
Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages or anywhere else without configuration.

### Why nobody else can write

- The page does nothing at all until a token is entered — a visitor who finds it
  sees a lock screen, and not one request leaves their browser.
- The token is *yours*, kept in your own browser (localStorage, or sessionStorage
  if you choose "this session only"). It is never stored in the repo, the build,
  a cookie or a server.
- Writing is authorised by GitHub, not by the page: the token only works for
  whoever owns it, and you can revoke it in one click.
- `/write/` is marked `noindex`, disallowed in `robots.txt`, sent with an
  `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header on Netlify, and left out of the sitemap.

Set `adminLink: ''` in `src/site.config.js` if you would rather the header had no
"Write" button at all — the page still works at its address.

### One-time setup: a GitHub token (two minutes)

1. Open **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens →
   Generate new token** (<https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>).
2. **Repository access:** "Only select repositories" → *this* repository.
3. **Permissions → Repository permissions → Contents:** `Read and write`.
   That single permission is all the desk needs.
4. Generate it, copy the `github_pat_…` string, and paste it into `/write/`.
   Choose **Keep on this device** for your own phone, **This session only**
   anywhere shared.

If the repository is forked or renamed, update `writeDesk` in
`src/site.config.js` — owner, repo, branch, posts folder and media folder all
live there.

### What the desk does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Library** | every post, marked Live or Draft, with filter chips |
| **Write / Preview** | one pane on a phone, side by side on a wide screen |
| **Pen menu** | the nine pens, six highlighters and nine typefaces your stylesheet already defines |
| **Toolbar** | bold, italic, heading, quote, list, link |
| **Photos** | upload from the camera roll straight into `public/uploads/` |
| **Autosave** | unfinished writing is kept on the device, and offered back next visit |
| **Drafts** | saved with `draft: true`, so the build leaves them off the site entirely |
| **Rename** | changing the address moves the file, so a post never appears twice |
| **Protected `main`** | falls back to committing on a branch and gives you a pull-request link |
| **Live check** | after publishing it watches for the new page and tells you when it is up |

### Verification built in

```bash
npm run check:desk      # markdown preview, frontmatter round trips, base64, built page
npm run check:desk:ui   # 9 simulated sessions: unlock, write, publish, draft, rename,
                        # protected branch, autosave recovery, lock — in a real DOM
npm run test:desk       # the above, plus a real `astro build` of a desk-written post
```

`check:desk` and `check:desk:ui` both run inside `npm run verify`, so CI fails if
the editor ever stops writing files the site can build.

### The old dashboard at /admin/ (optional, unused)

`public/admin/` still holds the Decap CMS bundle from the earlier setup. It needs
Netlify **Identity** *and* **Git Gateway** switched on, plus an invitation email,
and it adds ~6.6 MB to every deploy. Nothing links to it any more. To use it
locally without any account:

```bash
npm run dev            # terminal 1 — the site on :4321
npx decap-server       # terminal 2 — the CMS backend on :8081
```

Then open **http://localhost:4321/admin/** and press *Login* — no password; Decap
writes straight to your working copy. To retire it completely, delete
`public/admin/`, `scripts/check-admin-assets.mjs`, `scripts/validate-cms-config.mjs`,
`scripts/test-cms-roundtrip.mjs` and the `check:cms` / `check:admin` / `test:cms`
lines from `package.json`, and drop the `/admin/*` block from `netlify.toml`.

Roughly a minute after you press Publish, the commit triggers a rebuild and the
post appears on the home page, the blog index, the tag page, the RSS feed and the
sitemap. Set `identityWidget: true` in `src/site.config.js` if you want
invitation emails to work when they land on the home page rather than `/admin/`
(the setting is explained in that file).

### What the desk writes

| Folder | What it holds | From the desk |
|---|---|---|
| `src/content/blog/*.md` | one file per post | **create, edit, rename, delete** |
| `public/uploads/*` | cover and inline images | **upload from the camera roll** |
| `src/content/resources/*.md` | your recommended links | edit in the repository |
| `src/content/pages/*.md` | the About and Resources copy | edit in the repository |

Every post field the schema validates is in the editor: title, date, updated,
summary, tags, featured, draft, cover image and the markdown body. New posts start
as **drafts** (`draft: true`), so a half-finished post never reaches the live
site — flip the switch to *Published* when it is ready.

The desk writes the same frontmatter shape as the rest of the folder
(`title: "…"`, `date: "YYYY-MM-DD"`, `tags: ["a", "b"]`) and it *reads* anything
the old dashboard left behind, including js-yaml's folded multi-line values.

If you keep `/admin/` as well, `npm run check:cms` still checks its collections
against the Astro schema and `npm run test:cms` still builds posts the way Decap
writes them. On a host other than Netlify, Decap's `git-gateway` backend needs
replacing with the GitHub backend — the desk needs no such change, because it
never used a gateway at all.

---

## Writing a post

Create a markdown file in `src/content/blog/`. The filename becomes the URL:
`src/content/blog/my-new-post.md` → `/blog/my-new-post/`.

```markdown
---
title: "The headline readers will see"
date: 2026-10-05
tags: ["writing", "habits"]
summary: "One or two sentences used on cards, in search results and in the RSS feed."
featured: false       # true puts it in the big slot on the home page
draft: false          # true keeps it out of the build entirely
cover: "/uploads/a-photo.jpg"   # optional
---

Your post starts here. Everything the old editor could do still works, because
the renderer understands the same markup:

- **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`
- lists, tables, quotes, dividers and links
- fenced code blocks with a language
- raw HTML for the pen colours:

A <span class="c-terracotta">terracotta clause</span>, a
<span class="c-blue">blue aside</span>, a <mark class="hl-yellow">highlight</mark>
and a switch of typeface: <span class="f-playfair">Playfair</span>.
```

Every field is validated when you build. A typo in the frontmatter or a bad URL
stops the build with a message naming the file, instead of shipping a broken page.

**Drafts** (`draft: true`) never reach the output — no page, no feed entry, no
sitemap listing. Flip the flag when the post is ready.

### The nine typefaces and the pens

The full palette is in `public/styles.css`; these are the class names the old
writing desk produced, and they work exactly the same here:

| | |
|---|---|
| Pens | `c-ink` `c-terracotta` `c-blue` `c-green` `c-plum` `c-amber` `c-crimson` `c-indigo` `c-teal` |
| Highlighters | `hl-yellow` `hl-mint` `hl-sky` `hl-rose` `hl-lavender` `hl-peach` |
| Typefaces | `f-lora` `f-merriweather` `f-playfair` `f-inter` `f-poppins` `f-jetbrains` `f-serif` `f-sans` `f-mono` |

Site-wide typography (which face the body and headings use, and the reading
size) lives in `src/site.config.js` under `typography`.

## Migrating more posts from the old app

The original dynamic app (writing desk + `data/db.json`) is untouched at
`../blog`. If you add posts there and want them here:

```bash
npm run migrate                      # reads ../blog/data/db.json
npm run migrate -- --from /path/to/db.json
npm run migrate -- --force           # overwrite files that already exist
```

It writes posts, resources and both prose pages, and refreshes
`src/site.config.js`. Existing files are kept unless you pass `--force`, so
local edits are safe.

**Or skip the old app entirely** — a markdown file in `src/content/blog/` is all a
post ever needed.

---

## The newsletter form

A static site has no server to collect addresses, so `src/site.config.js` offers
two honest options:

```js
newsletter: {
  heading: 'Letters, occasionally',
  blurb: '…',
  endpoint: '',        // ← paste a form service URL here
  mode: 'mailto',
}
```

- **Leave `endpoint` empty** (the default): the form hands the address to your
  inbox through the visitor's own mail app. No third party, works immediately.
- **Set `endpoint`** to a form service — Buttondown, Formspree, Mailchimp,
  ConvertKit — and the form POSTs `{"email": "…"}` there instead, showing
  "Subscribing…" and a thank-you note.

---

## Search, tags and pagination

- **Search** is a browser-side filter over the posts already on the page (with a
  `?q=` in the address bar so the state is shareable). No index to maintain.
- **Tags** are real pages: `/blog/tag/writing/`, generated from the posts.
- **Pagination** appears automatically past 9 posts per page
  (`postsPerPage` in `src/site.config.js`).

---

## Verifying the port

`scripts/compare-with-dynamic.py` fetches every page from the old dynamic app and
compares it against the built HTML: visible text, class names, and counts of
cards, tags and links. With the old app running on port 3010 it reports:

```
PASS  /                                 text ✓  classes ✓
PASS  /blog                             text ✓  classes ✓
PASS  /about                            text ✓  classes ✓
PASS  /resources                        text ✓  classes ✓
PASS  /blog/the-pen-menu-and-how-to-use-it   text ✓  classes ✓
… ALL PAGES MATCH
```

---

## Deploying

The full walkthrough — GitHub, host setup, the writing desk, and a verification
checklist — is in **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**. The short version:

1. `npm run verify`, then push the repo to GitHub.
2. Point Netlify or Cloudflare Pages at it: build command `npm run build`,
   publish directory `dist`, and `NODE_VERSION=22.12.0`.
3. Set `SITE_URL` to your domain in the host's environment variables.
4. Make a fine-grained GitHub token with **Contents: Read and write** on this
   repository, paste it into `/write/`, and start writing. No host settings, no
   Identity, no OAuth worker — the desk is the same on every host.

Manual deploys work too:

```bash
SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com npm run build   # → dist/, plain static files
```

- **Vercel** — framework preset Astro, output directory `dist`
- **GitHub Pages** — publish the contents of `dist/` (set `base` in
  `astro.config.mjs` if the site lives at a subpath)
- **Any host** — copy the folder with `rsync`/`scp`; nothing needs to run

Every push to `main` runs the workflow in `.github/workflows/build-and-verify.yml`,
which builds the site, exercises the writing desk in a DOM, and fails the run if a
post's frontmatter is wrong, the editor stops working, or a link is broken.

---

## Notes on behaviour changes from the dynamic app

- Publish is now a commit: the writing desk at `/write/` writes markdown into the
  repo and the host rebuilds. Your words are in git with a full history, and the
  deploy is the review step.
- The **view counter** on posts is gone (nothing to count with), as is the
  subscriber list — a static site has nowhere to keep them. The newsletter form
  hands addresses to your inbox or to a form service; see below.
- The About page's *"I usually write about"* chips are drawn from your three
  favourite posts, matching the old templates. Swap `favourites` for `posts` in
  `src/pages/about.astro` to list every topic you have ever used.
- Raw HTML in markdown is passed straight through, as before. One difference: the
  old renderer escaped a stray `<` in prose (`5 &lt; 10`), the new engine passes
  it through — write `&lt;` if you need a literal less-than sign in a sentence.
